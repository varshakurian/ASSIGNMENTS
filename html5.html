<b><h2 id="computer"><u>COMPUTER</u></h2><a href="#top">TOC</a></b>
<p>An electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals. </p>
<h4><b><u>CPU</u></b></h4>
<p>CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.</p>
<h4><b><u>ALU</u></b></h4>
<p>
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer</p>
<b><h2 id="pro"><u>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</u></h2><a href="#top">TOC</a></b>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<h4><b><u>C<SUP>++</SUP></u></b></h4>
<p>C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. C++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C++ is one of the most popular programming language for graphical applications, such as those that run in Windows and Macintosh environments.</p>
<h4><b><u>C</u></b></h4>
<p>C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C to create lists of instructions for a computer to follow. C is one of thousands of programming languages currently in use.</p>
<b><h2 id="DBMS"><u>DBMS</u></h2><a href="#top">TOC</a></b>
<P>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</P>
<h4><b><u>RDBMS</u></b></h4>
<P>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</P>
<h4><b><u>HDBMS</u></b></h4>
<p>Keywords: HDBMS, NDBMS, RDBMS, OODBMS, Parameterized Comparison. I. INTRODUCTION. A Database Management System or DBMS is software designed to assist in maintaining and utilizing large collections of. data, and the need for such systems, as well as their use, is growing rapidly.</p>
